Total Site Area is calculated in script in table 3. 
This is the overlap of three things: the InSAR, the buffered region (large polygon) and the 100*100s. 
Therefore, this should be the largest area basically equivelant to sum of the 100 by 100s. 

Total Palsa area uses the palsa ha in the 100*100s
times by the actual palsa % in each to provide the previous authors estimate of palsa
This used select by location and then extracted as a csv

Average % is the percentage used in the above calculations
